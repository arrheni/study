ss command: Display Linux TCP / UDP Network/Socket Information
last updated May 8, 2018 in Categories Debian Linux, Howto, Linux, Monitoring, Networking, RedHat/Fedora Linux, Sys admin, Troubleshooting, Ubuntu Linux

The ss command is used to show socket statistics. It can display stats for PACKET sockets, TCP sockets, UDP sockets, DCCP sockets, RAW sockets, Unix domain sockets, and more. It allows showing information similar to netstat command. It can display more TCP and state information than other tools. It is a new, incredibly useful and faster (as compared to netstat) tool for tracking TCP connections and sockets. SS can provide information about:

All TCP sockets.
All UDP sockets.
All established ssh / ftp / http / https connections.
All local processes connected to X server.
Filtering by state (such as connected, synchronized, SYN-RECV, SYN-SENT,TIME-WAIT), addresses and ports.
All the tcp sockets in state FIN-WAIT-1 and much more.

Some Linux distro considered the nestat command as deprecated and therefore should be phased out in favor of more modern replacements such as ss command. Most Linux distributions shipped with ss and many monitoring tools. Being familiar with this tool helps enhance your understanding of whatâ€™s going on in the system sockets and enables you to find the possible causes of a performance problem.

Type the following to see process named using open socket:
# ss -pl

Find out who is responsible for opening socket / port # 4949 using the ss command and grep command:
# ss -lp | grep 4949

Sample output:

0      0                            *:4949                          *:*        users:(("munin-node",3772,5))
munin-node (PID # 3772) is responsible for opening port # 4949. You can get more information about this process (like memory used, users, current working directory and so on) visiting /proc/3772 directory:
# cd /proc/3772
# ls -l

# ss -x -a

Sample outputs:
ss command in action on Linux

Display All Established SMTP Connections
# ss -o state established '( dport = :smtp or sport = :smtp )'

Display All Established HTTP Connections
# ss -o state established '( dport = :http or sport = :http )'

Find All Local Processes Connected To X Server
# ss -x src /tmp/.X11-unix/*

List All The Tcp Sockets in State FIN-WAIT-1
List all the TCP sockets in state -FIN-WAIT-1 for our httpd to network 202.54.1/24 and look at their timers:
# ss -o state fin-wait-1 '( sport = :http or sport = :https )' dst 202.54.1/24

How Do I Filter Sockets Using TCP States?
The syntax is as follows:

## tcp ipv4 ##
ss -4 state FILTER-NAME-HERE
 
## tcp ipv6 ##
ss -6 state FILTER-NAME-HERE
Where FILTER-NAME-HERE can be any one of the following,

established
syn-sent
syn-recv
fin-wait-1
fin-wait-2
time-wait
closed
close-wait
last-ack
listen
closing
all : All of the above states
connected : All the states except for listen and closed
synchronized : All the connected states except for syn-sent
bucket : Show states, which are maintained as minisockets, i.e. time-wait and syn-recv.
big : Opposite to bucket state.

Type the following command to see closing sockets:

How Do I Matches Remote Address And Port Numbers?
Use the following syntax:

ss dst ADDRESS_PATTERN
 
## Show all ports connected from remote 192.168.1.5##
ss dst 192.168.1.5
 
## show all ports connected from remote 192.168.1.5:http port##
ss dst 192.168.1.5:http
ss dst 192.168.1.5:smtp
ss dst 192.168.1.5:443
Find out connection made by remote 123.1.2.100:http to our local virtual servers:
# ss dst 123.1.2.100:http

How Do I Matches Local Address And Port Numbers?
ss src ADDRESS_PATTERN
### find out all ips connected to nixcraft.com ip address 75.126.153.214 ###
## Show all ports connected to local 75.126.153.214##

## smtp (25) port only ##
ss src 75.126.153.214:smtp
ss src 75.126.153.214:25
How Do I Compare Local and/or Remote Port To A Number?
Use the following syntax:

## Compares remote port to a number ##
ss dport OP PORT
 
## Compares local port to a number ##
sport OP PORT
Where OP can be one of the following:

<= or le : Less than or equal to port
>= or ge : Greater than or equal to port
== or eq : Equal to port
!= or ne : Not equal to port
< or gt : Less than to port
> or lt : Greater than to port
Note: le, gt, eq, ne etc. are use in unix shell and are accepted as well.

ss vs netstat command speed
Use the time command to run both programs and summarize system resource usage. Type the netstat command as follows:
# time netstat -at

Sample outputs:

real	2m52.254s
user	0m0.178s
sys	0m0.170s
Now, try the ss command:
# time ss -atr

Sample outputs:

real	2m11.102s
user	0m0.124s
sys	0m0.068s
Note: Both outputs are taken from reverse proxy acceleration server running on RHEL v6.x amd64. For more info see ss command man page by typing the following command:
$ man ss

See https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/iproute2 for info on the ss and iproute2.
